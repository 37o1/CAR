# CAR

![CAR Org. Logo](./media/car_logo.png)

This is an ARG database of documents. It is structured as an archive. Feel free to read in. This project is a work of fiction and none of its contents must be real, even though scientific plausability is the goal.

"CAR (Cryptobiology Anomaly Research) Org." is a made up entity that this ARG project revolves around. There are no known real similar organizations to my knowledge and any similarities are purely a coincidence.

This project is currently only maintained by me. Help me with the project by sharing your ideas <a href="https://t.me/carorganization">in the official telegram channel</a> or by donating.
